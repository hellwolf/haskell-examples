Subject: Should there be a haskell template for inclusion polymorphism in Haskell?

Hi Haskellers!

Here are some of my thoughts about polymorphism in Haskell especially the inclusion polymorphism, with questions in the
end.

~IGNORE THESE LHS BOILER PLATES~

* Classification of Polymorphism

Let's assume that we are following the classification of polymorphism where there are four types of it:

?? Btw, does anyone have a good citation of this classification? I got it from all over the Internet instead:
e.g https://www.tutorialspoint.com/types-of-polymorphisms-ad-hoc-inclusion-parametric-and-coercion

** Overloading Polymorphism

It allows function with same name to act in different manner for different types.

** Coercion Polymorphism

Also called as casting sometimes.

** Inclusion Polymorphism

Also called as subtyping. This allows to point derived classes using base class pointers and references.

** Parametric Polymorphism

Also called early Binding, it allows to use same piece of code for different types. We can get it by using templates.

** Sub Classifications

In terms of being ad-hoc or universal:

- Overloading and Coercion are ad-hoc,
- Inclusion and Parametric are universal.

In terms of being compile-time vs run-time:

- Coercion, Overloading, Parametric are all compile-time polymorphism,
- while only Inclusion is run-time polymorphism.

* Different Polymorphism in Haskell

In terms of their counter parties in Haskell language:

** Overloading Polymorphismin Haskell

I think type classes basically provides such overloading ad-hoc polymorphism.

Some thinks so too: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6636107/how-does-haskell-handle-overloading-polymorphism

> class Fooable a where
>     foo :: a -> Int
> instance Fooable Int where
>     foo = id
> instance Fooable Bool where
>     foo _ = 42

** Coercion Polymorphism in Haskell

I think Haskell has both `Coercible` & `unsafeCoerce` for handling representational equality in compile time.

But I am not sure if c/c++ style of conercion between similar types such as int/float/double is something Haskell would
want to inject these magic conversion code ever.

** Parametric Polymorphism in Haskell

This is probably what Haskell is best at the most, demonstrated by the classic `map` function definition:

> map' :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
> map' _ []     = []
> map' f (x:xs) = f x : map' f xs

Note that, one could also combine parametric and overloading together using constraints:

> double :: Num a => a -> a
> double x = x + x

This `double` function is parametric, but constrained only to work with Num type classes, hence their implementations
are overloaded.

** Inclusion Polymorphism in Haskell

Ok, finally inclusion polymorphism is what I want to focus on and have some questions here.

Before that, I do want to mention one observation, inclusion polymorphism probably is most likely the old OOP habits
that die hard. For me at least, since I consider myself a recovering OOP run-time polymorphism addict, and my guess is
that unless the use case do need run-time polymorphism, e.g. run-time execution layer abstration, it is often better off
using other type of polymorphism to achieve the same result. And even Bjarne Stroustrup is flirting with the idea:
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcpSLRpOMJM][Bjarne Stroustrup - Object Oriented Programming without Inheritance - ECOOP 2015]]

Let's think of translating this piece of pseudo OOP style code into haskell.

```
interface Num {
  Num (+)(Num a, Num b);
  Num (*)(Num a, Num b);
  Num abs(Num a);
  Num negate(Num a);
  Num signum(Num a);
  Num fromInteger(Integer);
}

interface Show {
  String show(Show a);
}

class AnyNum<T> implements Num, Show {
  // trivially implements Num Show interfaces
}

// Now we can use AnyNum<Int>, AnyNum<Double>, etc. through their Num or Show interfaces.
```

In Haskell though, thanks to the ability of having existential type, AnyNum is actually quite nice to write:

> data AnyNum where
>   MkAnyNum :: (Num a, Show a) => a -> AnyNum

But in order to use AnyNum like using interfaces in our pseudo code, we would have to write these boiler plates and in
some cases using unsafeCoerce due to not using Typeable run-time information:

> instance Num AnyNum where
>   (+) (MkAnyNum a) (MkAnyNum b) = MkAnyNum $ a + unsafeCoerce b
>   (*) (MkAnyNum a) (MkAnyNum b) = MkAnyNum $ a + unsafeCoerce b
>   abs (MkAnyNum a) = MkAnyNum . abs $ a
>   negate (MkAnyNum a) = MkAnyNum . negate $ a
>   signum (MkAnyNum a) = MkAnyNum . signum $ a
>   fromInteger = MkAnyNum . fromInteger
> instance Show AnyNum where
>   show (MkAnyNum a) = show a

Here is some test code that demonstrate how distressful unsafeCoerce is:

> main = do
>   let a = MkAnyNum(1 :: Int)
>   let b = MkAnyNum(2 :: Double)
>   let c = MkAnyNum(3 :: Int)
>   print $ show $ a + b
>   print $ show $ a + c

Outputs are:
```

"4611686018427387905"
"4"
```

Few observations:

- If there is at most one occurance of the usage of the type class, there is no need for the unsafeCoerce.
- Otherwise, unsafeCoerce is required, or otherwise those functions could be left to "undefined".

So my central questions for discussions are:

- Is inclusion polymorphism something we should use at all in Haskell?
- These boiler plate code maybe better be generated using Haskell template instead, is there one already, or should
  there be one?
